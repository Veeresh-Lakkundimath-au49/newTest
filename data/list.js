Change is the manifestation of time, and time has shown us that skateboarding is here for as long as we—as individuals and as a community—create it into existence. Although much of the world is trying to stunt skateboarding's growth, there are enough rogue individuals out there continuing to make it happen. Whether it be by building ledges at a remote spot just east of downtown LA, constructing mini-ramps in our backyards, or buying buildings and constructing skateparks inside them like ourselves, we continue to grow because our will to skate and our will to survive is just that strong and because the only alternative is to quit and die. But we at the Berrics believe that life was made to live out of, not die out of. There's nothing special about dying. Anyone can do that. Push the future. —Steve Berra & Eric Koston",
